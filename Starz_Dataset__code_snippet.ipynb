A separate cluster in the top-right shows stars that break the pattern - they're cool but extremely luminous, indicating they must be physically enormous Another group in the bottom-left contains hot but faint stars, suggesting they're very compact objects The color gradient shows clear separation between stellar classes, with each color family occupying its own territory on the diagram\n",
